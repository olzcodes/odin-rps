## To-Do

- [DONE] create basic graphical user interface
- refine layout and graphics
- add animations ?
- add sounds ?

## What I learnt from this project

- Early design choices become harder to reverse once I start adding complexity on top. For example, I used the HTML table element to display scores and this was probably not the best choice as it limits the changes that can be made to spacing and layout.
