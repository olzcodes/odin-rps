This was a two-part project.

The aim of part 1 was to build a Rock Paper Scissors game that runs in the browser console.

## What I learnt from this project

- Early design choices become harder to reverse once I start adding complexity on top. For example, I used the HTML table element to display scores and this was probably not the best choice as it limits the changes that can be made to spacing and layout.
- Code can get messy very quickly. It is worth spending extra time on creating a good design and mapping out the user flows before writing any JavaScript.
